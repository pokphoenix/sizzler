Selectize-SCSS
===============

[Selectize.js](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js) is a great jQuery-plugin for displaying custom `<select>`-elements. Unfortunately it relies on LESS as a CSS-precompiler.

As I personally rely on SCSS and I also want to be able to configure the design of Selectize.js by using variables, I made a port to SCSS.

## Installation

You can either down the [ZIP-archive](https://github.com/herschel666/selectize-scss/archive/v0.10.1.zip) or fetch it from the bower-registry:

	bower install selectize-scss --save

Thereby you'll get the whole package as **Selectize.js** is set as a dependency.

## Bootstrap 2

At the moment there's only the Default- and the Bootstrap3-theme, as there's no official SASS-port of Bootstrap2. If you're in urgent need for the Bootstrap2-theme, maybe you want to contribute?!
